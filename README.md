# Contactless Automatic Switching using LPC2148

This project implements a **contactless automatic switching system** using an **LPC2148 ARM7 microcontroller**, IR sensors, relay module, and a DC motor driver.  
The system enables **hands-free control** of electrical devices, improving hygiene, safety, and convenience.

## 📌 Project Overview

Contactless switching eliminates the need for physical interaction with switches.  
An **IR sensor** detects the presence of a hand or object and sends a signal to the **LPC2148 microcontroller**, which processes the input and activates a **relay** and **DC motor** accordingly.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Design a contactless switching system using IR sensors
- Ensure safe isolation between control and high-power circuits
- Improve hygiene and ease of operation
- Demonstrate applications in automation and consumer electronics

## ⚙️ Working Principle

1. IR sensor detects hand/object presence
2. Signal is sent to LPC2148 microcontroller
3. Microcontroller processes the input
4. Relay is activated
5. DC motor or load operates without physical contact

Single and double hand waves are used to control ON/OFF actions.
